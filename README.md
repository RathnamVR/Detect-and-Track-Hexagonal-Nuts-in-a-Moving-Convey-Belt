# Detect-and-Track-Hexagonal-Nuts-in-a-Moving-Convey-Belt
A video similar to the top view of a moving convey belt with hexagonal nuts on it has been used here. Hexagonal nuts in this video have been detected and tracked using a template hexagonal nut image. After that nuts are uniquely numbered to output a video similar to the input video but with relevant information.
